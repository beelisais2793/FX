**ABSTRACT**

The musical composition is close to a *point break*: almost one hundred
years ago Ottorino Respighi introduced a recorded media into his
orchestral composition *I Pini di Roma* [@ropr25] and, even today, we
don't have a shared consolidate electroacoustic practice to play it
likewise the orchestral one. Someone does it better than others, by its
own equilibrium between knowledge and consciousness. After all, it is
only a recorded bird sound to be placed inside an orchestra, not a
virtuoso part to be played on a handmade custom electroacoustic
instrument disappeared from the earth except by memories and score
notes. The problem is more serious and profound if we consider that most
of today's electroacoustic manipulators don't know who Respighi was,
what happened after him and what are the differences between his pioneer
usage of recordings, instead of the later compositional purpose usage
made by John Cage [@cjil39]. Something must change to introduce a way
that conducts a consolidation practice on electroacoustic literature.

## Introduction

*Sustained Electro-Acoustic Music* is a project inspired by Alvise
Vidolin and Nicola Bernardini's article [@bevi05] on *live
electroacoustic music sustainability*. In their text, they point at
multiple technical faces of the sustainability problem such as
technological, notational or general conception issues. Even if the
article aforementioned focuses only on *live* electroacoustic music, the
concept of sustainability is applicable to any kind of documented music
that uses electroacoustic environments including therefore the
acousmatic works, instruments mixed with tape and structured amplified
works. This will be the purpose of the presented text.

The ambition of this project is to grow the interpretation and the
electroacoustic musical practice with the consciousness of the
electronic and informatics problems that had made arduous to approach
this music and prevented the growth of interpretative thinking. It is
possible, with a community structure, to determine, build and stratify
interpretation of musical core, the repertoire, concealing the
environment-related technological issues. They are instruments, not the
music itself, after all.

When we refer to a virtuoso musician, we often point at a violinist or
at a piano player: someone who intensely practice on his instrument.
This is the central point: Does the violinist builds its own violin
every time he approaches a new composition? Does the pianist? The
electroacoustic musician does it, every time.

## Problems

The electroacoustic music culture was born in a daily changing context.
The sustainability of what the electroacoustic musicians and composers
were doing, during the years, wasn't an interesting and useful point
during the realisation of the compositions.

> Interpretation is a way to overcome the technological obsolescence
> that every computer musician knows very well. \[...\] In the beginning
> of IRCAM, no one was aware of the seriousness of the problem: the
> works produced in the 1980s were made with a total lack of concern for
> this issue or with an optimistic technophily. We realized the problem
> later, in the beginning of the 21st century [@lem16].

A point consists exactly in the necessity of a definition of computer
music or more generally computer-something, today. *Computer Music* was
to mean something when differences between technologies started to be
also compositional and musical differences. Today's evidence is that
there's no music without the computer and so far we need to move on, to
change, develop and solve other problems with a proper language,
otherwise, the situation will remain similar to decades ago.
Sustainability is an intricate and complex concept, and music
sustainability sounds like an abstract problem, applied to an abstract
thing only for a small number of people, such as an abstract community
not related to the mass. Again, we acknowledge that mass-media,
mass-culture, mass-society-things, are no place for the *sustained
people*.

Traditionally, music composition developed through an interdisciplinary
approach to research on sound and perception and writing itself. In
other words, writing something that pushes the writing itself into
becoming writing, towards the best comprehension of something. If actual
music is afflicted or not by the contemporary and electroacoustic music
issues, it is an ordinary question, but the evidence that musical
thinking changed through the electroacoustic thought is an undeniable
fact. Music was changed inexorably after the introduction of electronics
and informatics in composition, as well as the way how it has
transformed the approach to playing and production. We are not speaking
about the inevitable technologic half of those facts, but of the musical
one, built on literature and interpretation.

> To create its repertoire, the institute asked composers to write works
> interacting with the institute's research departments [@lem16].

The mutation was deep enough to change some general directions, which
turned out to be oriented to technical issues with technical approaches
and solutions. That too technical, but less musical, approach has sliced
the musical practice and composition (even the technological one) from
the practice of an instrument (even the technological one also in this
case).

## Neatly Layering

Deutsche Grammophon released three interpretations of Beethoven's
Complete Symphonies of the four made by the conductor Herbert von
Karajan in less than 35 years [@rrrnyt]. Each of those boxsets is a
collection of reproduction, not the music itself. We consider it a huge
resource of thinking, (Beethoven's thinking through the Karajan's one)
not a huge resource of music itself. Every man who has listened to
Beethoven's music in a concert hall knows perfectly that his music can't
fit in a box that can be placed in a hand. This point of view is not in
coincidence with the discographic purpose that it was built for, but it
doesn't matter. The point is that we have stratified musical thinking
and listening attitude on Beethoven's music through interpretations of
his music. We does have not rewritten his music each time and we have
not built his instruments each time from ground zero. Is it a
technological fact? A musical one? Both of them.

Luigi Nono's repertoire is not on a triple boxset of no one. It is on
paper in the best-case scenario [@raprmt]. The *Archivio Luigi Nono*
does an immense musicological and production work by keeping and
preserving Nono's works. So the question is: Do we have some Nono's
works recordings? Yes, we have them, but what can we study and interpret
of his lately composed music, like *Risonanze Erranti* (mentioned later
in this article), in which half of the ensemble not to consist in
traditional acoustical instruments, but in *Live Electronics
Instruments*, dated the '80s and not fully described and neither
sustained through the years? There are people that have memories of
those disappeared instruments from musical daily doing and, after all,
they have directly worked with Nono and can accurately describe and
share what happened and what can today happen.

> In the classical music context, a musical interpretation requires the

> audience, the hall, and the other performers [@lem16].

Looking at the Post-Graduate Doctoral offers for an electroacoustic
musician career all over the world, there are many
*interactive-all-you-can-think-about* positions, but nothing about
practising the electroacoustic repertoire. There are a lot of *Machines
(that are) Learning* something, somewhere. All over the world, the music
industry conceived the purpose of doing music, with or without musical
problems to solve. During that well-studied interaction learning the art
of entertainment, where the industry is god, and *God is a DJ*,
meanwhile, it grows also a repertoire of music that we must consider the
core of the actual musical thinking and conception, that will disappear
in a few years if not *sustained*. Not the written papers, neither the
recordings of that repertoire. We have archives with *clouds* for that,
and some *machines* to manage and take care of that, maybe. But it will
disappear the practice, the interpretation, the sensibility and the
musical thinking itself from roots of musical comprehension, which are
at the same time the roof of composing, the inspiring starry sky. And
there will be no place to store these human-related aspects. If there
are clouds, they are grey and full of rain.

Here are the focal points. What will become the electroacoustic music
repertoire if not the one played in the concert hall? Why we do
concentrate too many resources and time on technical problems and not on
musical interpretations and playing practices of repertoire?

## The Seam Community

From seam meaning:

> A line where two pieces of fabric are sewn together...\
> An underground layer of a mineral such as coal or gold: the buried
> forests became seams of coal...\
> Join with a seam.

We have to study Vidolin's gestures to understand Nono, to have a clear
sight on our music through an era and join literature and practice with
a seam. Vidolin is for Nono what Karajan was for Beethoven: time,
consciousness and thinking. We need his work to know what was happening,
what we have to do, what is necessary and what doesn't matter. And that
is we have to do, seam it just one time, forever. Refine it, maintain
it, and again realise it, through practice, forever. Neatly layering
people's knowledge and thinking is the only way to hold back and
preserve what we are loosing, preventing music from being a boxset of
objects without the consciousness of music that they represent.

To prevent catastrophic regression of musical thinking we must consider
that there are few dogmatic concepts to build, re-build and sustain an
*electroacoustic repertoire*:

 1.  Open and Be Open
 2.  Don't Repeat Yourself
 3.  Think and Act as Community

**SEAM is an Open, DRY, Community.** People inside SEAM will share their
knowledge to weld words, papers and literature with meaning.

These are the SEAM organisation coordinates:
 - <http://s-e-a-m.github.io>
 - <http://seam-world.slack.com>

There are notably predecessors of this kind of initiative, with a more
personal oriented use, some of them has inspired this project, like the
Miller Puckette's repository[^2]. We hope the public domain community
profile of SEAM can include some of those precious wizards contributes,
in a more community sense, to avoid the misunderstanding of literature.
An only-tech reading can bring to wrong interpretations even for great
tech minds. That's how Puckette [@mp01] resolve a crucial description of
the *Dialogue*:

> This piece in its published form is performed by one clarinetist
> accompanied by a tape of the same clarinetist.

It is not accompanied, it is a dialogue.

### SEAM Instruments

Developing the concepts of the instrument and instrumentalist to the
combined form of those into interpretation, [@lem16; @mp01; @savi85]
requires the overcoming of obsolete parallelism: the computer music
performer as an artisan of *new-luthiery*. There is not a sustainability
conception under the deception of that wrong and obsolete metaphor. Each
*luthiery* is new, it evolve with musical needs. Each instrument has his
inventor and his virtuoso, but in musical history, those people never
coincided. The best instruments were conceived from men entirely devoted
to the conception of something unique. The best virtuoso took those
instruments to unveil their prospective.

During the lessons in Rome Conservatory in which *SEAM* was born and its
related problems were shared with classes to sensitize students to
community work, the core software used to explode issues was
*Faust*[^3]. This wasn't a restriction, it was a preference. Text-based
DSP offers the deepest learning experience and great expressivity and
readability. *Faust* code could be written to educate a musician at the
same time with computation versatility and efficiency. The *Faust
libraries* concept is useful to focus on write once, and read forever,
code. We think *Faust* itself represents a rather concept of
electroacoustic sustainability. Thinking, for example, at the
*filters.lib* and at the names that contributed the enrichment of
speculation around each object, make us wish to a musical interest
capable to do community more than with the adoption of other software.

Instruments carved by musical ideas on readable text (code) becomes a
sub-literature in which each brick maintain the power of the source
code, the clarity of an equation, the efficiency of the continuous
development, the reusability of a word in different contexts.

```text
import("stdfaust.lib");
import("../faust-libraries/seam.lib");
```

The *SEAM library* local importing points to other libraries catalogued
by arguments, like in *Standard Faust Libraries*.

Actually there are five different libraries:

 * seam.lib: contains general functions and the pointers to each specific
    library. It may also comprehend the custom performative environment
    definition, as it could be for the inputs and the outputs, the setup
    parameters and the performative controls.

 * gerzon.lib: contains early Michael Gerzon works, his core concepts of
    spatialization and stereophony, that conducted him to conceive the
    Ambisonic technology. In a sustained environment, the role of this
    library is to avoid misunderstanding of what *stereo* is [@ab58] and
    what we are loosing in the electroacoustic staging perception.

 * hardware.lib: contains hardware-related functions like MIDI mapping and I/O
    assignment to an audio interface, with a routing strategy to connect
    instruments to real-world hardware with a graphical user interface
    to map routing.

 * measurement.lib: contains some audio analysis strategy to define musical display
    feature for audio inspection, such as integrated measurement and
    loudness monitoring, that are indispensable tools for today staging
    of public addressed music.

 * nono.lib: is the first author-related library that points to contain *Live
    Electronics Instruments*. The idea is to collect instruments into
    the library and use them, work by work, in a hardware-like approach.
    The *nono.lib* should contain reusable instruments typical of his
    literature like the Harmonizer, the Halaphon, and so on, directly
    called back into the performance environment of each work, to
    enforce the reusability and the sustainability of those instruments.

Faust is a great tool and we are proud users of it, nevertheless, a
studied choose of the proper tool is required for each specific case.
Sustaining of proper choosing is most important than the comfort of the
preferred tools. As proposed to *max*-addicted students during lessons,
a *library* approach, like the *Faust* one, must be ever incentivized.

### SEAM Topology

Referring to the electroacoustic music literature, where the substantial
difference with the acoustical one is an inevitable continuously
changing of the environment, we prefer to use the topology
classification in place of typology one. A typology classification is,
according to general type, used where characteristics of something are
fixed and produce a catalogue of things. A topology classification
considers instead the time-space characteristics of shape and permits
the time variance of the environments. We classify three topologies of
the electroacoustic music in literature:

 * **The undocumented**: where composers use only word description to generate environment
    and circumstances;
 * **The *words-hole*** : where the score has deep technical documentation but listing names
    of undocumented instruments. Without musicological methodologies,
    frequently with names without a specific meaning;
 * **The porting**: where informatics translations between languages or informatics
    technologies are based on literature and shared knowledge.

The identification of topological classes in place of typological forms
is necessary to subordinate technology-matter to the musical practice
and poetics.

## Write the undocumented

*The undocumented* is the first topology class we approach. It holds all
works in which composers used only word descriptions to portray the
electroacoustic performing environment, with the rules and circumstances
needed. Like Ottorino Respighi does with *I Pini di Roma* [@ropr25] at
the very beginnings, many composers until now never documented their
works with specific usages of the technologies at their disposal. There
are tons of scores that implicitly involves particular amplification, or
complex electroacoustic staging, only by words description.

### 1969, *I am Sitting in a Room*, Alvin Lucier

Speaking at beginner music students about Lucier's *I am sitting in a
room*, is a kind of sharing of a multilevel experience. There are a lot
of access layers each with different bits of knowledge requirements. One
of these, of course, is how you can do it today.

The score state a text to be read, it explains what is going to happen
and why, so the process unveils the process itself. The acoustical
properties of the space transform the speech. The "resonant frequency of
the room reinforces themselves", while the others are absorbed, they are
attenuated by space. Space as an instrument to be played and articulated
by time.

> At the time of composition, the only way to realize the score of *I am
> sitting in a room* was with tape: using two recorders the text was
> recycled and re-recorded, and then all the version were spliced
> together chronologically. Concert performances consisted of playing
> back this composite tape \[...\] In the heyday of \"live Electronic
> Music\" \[...\] the piece *could* have been performed live \[...\] but
> to do so would have been to miss a subtle but important detail: \"I am
> sitting in a room *different* from the one you are in now.\" \[...\]
> *I am sitting in a room* conveys this sense of rightness in a way that
> transcends the mechanism, phenomena, and text of the piece. It pulls
> the listener along with process that, whether understandable or not,
> seems perfectly natural, totally fascinating, intensely personal, and
> poignantly musical. [@alCD90]

Today the work could be realised with live-electronics, without
interruption between cycles. It requires a simple delay line, sized as
much as the statement, to be infinitely recycled. Again, the sensibility
that had characterised the Lucier's Era, today, is overwhelmed by
anxiety and incapacity to observe something in time. The time-lapse
perception model is a *state of mind* constriction, so, with the maximum
technological support of an infinite digital delay line, without the
necessity of a full perception, *I am sitting* could be a surgical
time-waste, at best quality, of course. The idea of space as an
instrument expressed by this apostolic work requires ears and fingers
twisted in a full participated perception of time-space mutation during
the performance.

The very deep sustainability problem of that work isn't technical. It is
a simple process. The very deepest problem is sensibility. The worst
thing that can happen to the *process-music* is the perfect process
execution without the music. To seam process and music we need to unfold
ears and minds to the Lucier's perception and sensibility. How? Doing
it, like he exactly suggested fifty years ago: practising.

> Make versions in which one recorded statement is recycled through many
> rooms. Make versions using one or more speakers of different languages
> in different rooms. Make versions in which, for each generation, the
> microphone is moved to different parts of the room or rooms. Make
> versions that can be performed in real-time. [@lais69]

The many versions proposed by the author in the music score point to
multiple cases of electroacoustic staging. It is a
*free-your-electroacoustic-fantasy* statement, typical of the end of the
sixties, unfortunately forgot the day after. To reset future people's
perception by now, young musicians should do that for years, never
mapping one single patch in *max4live*. They need an instrument to
practise music.

The offline process remains, like the original statement says, really
unchanged. A double recording apparatus, of any nature, and a chair to
sit down and practise.

```text
main = vgroup("[01] Check both boxes to start", *(L) : de.delay(maxdel, D-1
  with{
  maxdel = ma.SR *(180);
  I = int(checkbox("[01] Uncheck me after the incipit"));
  C = (I-I') <= 0; // Clear del
  D = (+(I):*(C))~_; // Compute del time
  L = int(checkbox("[02] I am Sitting... Uncheck me at the end"));
};
```

The strategy adopted to create a real-time performative environment for
*I am sitting* is to count the samples of the duration of the initial
statement and pass that count to the delay time. The code proposed here
is only to evidence the straightforward writing in *Faust*, underlining
that part of the code is stolen from the *Faust* manual itself.

We propose three different ready-to-fight real-time environments, to
practice with the musical behaviour of the piece. The first is
one-in-one-out, easy to setup. The second is a stereophonic version,
where, per stereo sound, we refer to an unbreakable experience of
acoustical listening. [@ab58] The third is four-channel ambisonic
version, usable by who four-dimensionally thinks space-related issues,
like us, and wants to expand his perception.

```text
process = input : main : output;
```

We introduce a three-parted environment: inputs, main, outputs. It is
not a tautological issue, it is a way to insulates the main process by
the personalised environment. Declaring the main group as the only place
for the score related processes, each architectural custom construction
useful to staging it must be outside that region. So, each input channel
pre-processing and complex out-mix are predisposed in the relative
paths. By this way, a work-by-work practice is straightforward looking
inside the main boxes, and custom infrastructure remains the same every
time.

## Rewrite

The second topology of music score has a deep electroacoustic
documentation and an accurate specific musical notation. Nevertheless,
the documentation requires a musicological approach to unveil the
meaning of, what we defined, *words-hole*. *Risonanze Erranti* is a long
work of the latest Nono's composition period, with many live electronics
instruments inside the ensemble, some of that was undocumented hardware,
names without meaning, *words-hole*.

### 1989, *Risonanze Erranti*, Luigi Nono

To avoid misunderstanding, every technological rewriting based on
block-diagram must be a partial true. Each block named with an
intergalactic *words-hole* can lead everywhere. The sound of the
*Halaphon* (to cite one of the Nono's *words-hole* block) not exist. The
*Halaphon* was a way to connect pure musical thinking with consolidated
musical practice, embracing acoustical space and electronics. Before the
instrument itself, the *Halaphon*, was an idea of space-related music,
that became a necessity, and only at the end an opportunity.

> The Halaphon is a digital spatializer which, with the loudspeakers
> arranged in the room, controls the movement of sound in space. This
> movement must be continuous, with a soft, superimposed fading from one
> loudspeaker to another. The dynamics indicated in the score for the
> Contralto and the instruments also apply for the dynamics of the
> Halaphon outputs [@nlre87].

Words can define and reduce some issues to integrate diagrams and
musical notation where they are lacunose or obscure. Reading a musical
score unknowing the mental state of the composer that brought it to the
world is a daily committed crime. A composer poetics is inevitably
invoked into the work he is producing and in his musical practice and
research. Even when there are knowledge and structured thinking, even
then, we can produce the wrong questions to obtain the right, not
necessary, answer.

> The reverberation effect is only given a duration (is it a plate or
> spring reverb? are there any filter or early reflection settings?). We
> elected to use a high quality Lexicon reverb as we believed that this
> worked best musically. In other areas detailed information is given,
> such as precise frequencies/bandwidths for the two filter banks used
> [@rw05].

In other areas, detailed information is given, such as precise
frequencies/bandwidths for the two filter banks used, because they are
musical related instrument information. An example of a not musical
related instrument information is in *Risonanze* score:

> This reverberation time only occurs in connection with the voice of
> the Contralto, and is always replayed on loudspeakers L9, 10, placed
> in the middle of the room, at the top. Depending on the acoustics of
> the hall, it may be increased to 5 seconds: However, this decision
> should only be taken in relation to the duration of other
> reverberations [@nlre87].

The difference between what could be instrument or not is very clear:
the articulated performability through listening. A frequency/bandwidth
is a clear musical reference, as the pitch. The sound produced by a
typology of reverb is an architectural choice, as the choice of the
space in which stage the piece.

> Io entro nello Studio di Freiburg, sempre, \"senza idee\". Senza

> frantumazioni [@nono85][^4].

If there is something that must be sustained is exactly that musical
behaviour. Each of those Nono's words conducts the musician to agile and
deeply performable electroacoustic musical environments. So it passes
the concept of an instrumental practice consolidated on the means and
tools available. Nono himself talks about it by transversally crossing
architecture, classical musical practice and technology, in executive
and interpretative terms:

> Lo spazio è uno degli elementi con cui componi, anche se
> dall'Ottocento, dal tempo della sala da concerto e dell'opera, ciò non
> succede più. Tutto il melodramma italiano si è realizzato in una forma
> già prefissata. Ma continuare così sarebbe stato come considerare vera
> la sola forma sonata di un certo periodo della vita di Beethoven, come
> se lui non avesse continuamente trasformato e stravolto quella forma
> fino alle ultime sonate.
>
> Questo vuol dire, per me, pensare la musica. E la stessa cosa avviene

> anche di intervenire, modificare, trasformare tutto, completamente.

> sapere, di conoscenza, \[...\] noi verifichiamo continuamente le
> acustiche e inseriamo delle continue modifiche a ciò che ho pensato o
> scritto [@nono84][^5].

Musical score thinking and annotating procedure to obtain a musical
match, like the Nono's procedure of studying, practising, listening and
writing once between infinite possibilities; declare itself as an
attempt to do something not complete or not fully defined in its
process. The division by scenes of the routing, in the technical score,
is a procedure derived by the environment at their disposal. As we can
see through the scenes navigation, they are often a solution to an
old-complexity routing, but today most of these scenes could be joined
and driven by more flexible and accurate, multiple and automate remote
controllers.

## Porting

The porting of aged music informatics of experimental instruments to a
sustained programming language and technology merging into two branches
of interests of the authors: the history of instruments (even the
technological ones) and the *back to the future* of music lost in the
past for technological issues, into a new possibility of music playing.

### 1991, *Mobile Locale*, Michelangelo Lupone

Working side by side with Michelangelo Lupone for the *Mobile Locale*
[@lmml91] porting is something extremely musical related and only
marginally a technological and informatics matter. The main goal is the
possibility to interpret his music, with his unavoidable sensibility at
disposal of better comprehension of the music score. Close to this, the
fascinating possibility to revive a beautiful work, *Mobile Locale*,
stuck by technical problems that obscured its musical value. The work
was conceived around a technology born from the same Lupone's musical
thinking, at CRM[^6] (Music Research Centre, in Rome), the System Fly
[@ml85].

> The different cultural and professional backgrounds of the members of
> the team (musicians, physicists, engineers and musicologists) united
> by a common appreciation of interdisciplinary problems and all
> specialising in informatic systems, produced the group's present
> capacity to create a digital system oriented towards the synthesis,
> analysis and real-time processing of sound signals. This system
> develops an immediate interaction with the user and it is flexible and
> adaptable to the different scientific and artistic needs [@ml91].

The hardware and software development between the two systems, the *Fly
10* and the *Fly 30*, was oriented on real-time musical interaction as,
during those years, was pioneered by the institutionalized research
labs. At the same CIM[^7] event in which Lupone described the System Fly
[@ml85], Sylviane Sapir and Alvise Vidolin [@savi85] portray, with
inspiring words, the real-time *Prometeo* production

> Con l'avvento dei sistemi informatici in tempo reale è diventato
> possibile ri-mettere in diretta corrispondenza il gesto con il suono
> ricreando il feed-back azione-suono-ascolto-azione e, di conseguenza,
> far uscire gli elaboratori dai laboratori e concepire delle
> composizioni che prevedessero una esecuzione dal vivo sia autonoma sia
> integrata con altri strumenti tradizionali e non[^8].

Knowing the structure of *Fly 10*, shown in figure
[3](#ml-fly10){reference-type="ref" reference="ml-fly10"}, and its
procedure to generate sound at the electric stadium is fundamental to
understanding some of the composer tunings of algorithms, simultaneously
to balance the new real-time processing made by the porting mixed with
the original tape sound made with the *Fly 10* system. The 1991 state of
the art of the *System Fly 30* structure had 16Bit ADC/DAC with a sample
rate up to 96KHz. During the production, the sound engineer Piero
Schiavoni does the recordings, the editing and the mixing of *Mobile
Locale*. At this stage, the electronics on tape was upsampled to 16Bit
at 48000Hz. The sounds generated with today real-time architecture could
be in high resolution and at higher sampling frequencies. Discussing
with Lupone all those historical data and the new procedure, underlined
the necessity to have a set of filters, similar to those at the end of
*Fly* systems, to search a timbral balancing during the staging.

The entire electronics, both tape and live, was conceived as a shadow of
the acoustic percussions and amplification of them. So there are three
levels of musical matter on stage: the acoustic (a complex set of
percussions), the electroacoustic (sound reinforcement, early
reflections simulation and tape), the live electronics (real-time
processes based on three different delay lines usages).

During the staging strategy, the entire sound direction must be focused
on the balancing of the live electronics with the electroacoustic sound,
that has to be hidden, by all of these, inside the percussion
sounds[^9].

There are four places, areas, described in the general block diagram of
the algorithm, respectively: the *QAQF* Delay line with the sinusoidal
oscillating reading index, the comb filtering Early Reflections, the
scaled mix of the reflection into one channel and the two feedback delay
lines, with different step-index, named *WA* and *ZA*.

The *QAQF* is a delay line read by an oscillator pointer at some fixed
rates that, at the higher value of 320Hz, produces a broadband signal
that must be treated by the output filters discussed before.

The early reflections are simulated by the different delay times of
eight comb filters, projected to the audience by coupling them two by
two through the four channels. In the score instructions there are not
precise gain values of recursion inside the filters, instead they must
be taken directly from Fly 30 patch source code.

The two delays named WA and ZA have the feedback subtracted (not summed)
with the input signal. It is necessary to understand the timbral
significance of that choice, in the same perspective of timbral control
of the shadowed electronics.

The relationship between instrument, opera and musical idea as the core
of Lupone's composition process, brings again the conversation at the
necessity to have a musical instrument, not only an electronic
environment, mastered to focus on expected musical behaviour.

## Conclusions

With this article, the music sustainability concept was spread from live
electronics music to the broader electroacoustic music composition and
interpretation. The original issues [@bevi05] about music score
documentation in electronic music is the fundamental core of the
concept. Nevertheless, the focus of this research, and the approach,
point at a less technical and more compositional and practical situation
that afflicts not only the documentation of a score but the musical
thinking and practice at all.

The research defines different topologies of electroacoustic music (the
*undocumented*, where composers use only words descriptions to generate
environment and circumstances; the *words-hole* where the score has deep
technical documentation but listing names of undocumented instruments;
the *porting*, where informatics translations between languages, or
informatics technologies, are based on literature and shared knowledge)
consolidating emerging critical circumstances: sustainability is only
marginally related to the documentation and it is only superficially a
technical issue. The documentation is a quality parameter of
sustainability but it is the musical practising and interpreting that
will build musical thinking during the years.

The first concept to be clarified in the conclusions is that
sustainability must aim at maintaining the musical idea, the
peculiarities of the piece and of what we could define as the
*sustainability of the process*. The compositions here treated points up
to this fundamental aspect: the practice on difficulties raised studying
each musical literature work must become the documentable, sustainable
and improvable musical core of the repertoire.

To improve, share and grow the musical interpretation of repertoire
there are rules to be observed, and we derived them by informatics
sustainability itself: *Open and Be Open*, *Don't Repeat Yourself*,
*Think and Act as Community*.

The sustainability process also points at the fact that a community can
truly build instruments one time only, as a tool, and refine it. Making
it accessible through open-source would lead to the interpretation and
implementation of electroacoustic compositions, preserving electronic
thinking for a greater progression. Researching within contemporary
composing, means untying the possibilities of realisation from tools and
means available during music composition.

A community can operate as a Research Group, with a \"common
appreciation of interdisciplinary problems\" [@ml91], to bring a
time-frozen composition back to a warm and discussed work, out of a
solipsistic production-in-a-box typical of the personal computing era,
to focus on musical matters carved out on the personal knowledge,
outside the personal point of view.

It is necessary to focus on the main difference between technical
sustainability and musical sustainability. Technical sustainability
concerns the work, it is linked to the technical world that the work
defines. It is its carbon dating, the reproducible ecosystem, maybe, but
it is not the work itself. Musical sustainability is a matter of
thoughts, that makes use of those tools to go out towards the
perceptible. Supporting the thoughts is supporting music, perception and
listening.

[^4]: I always enter in the Freiburg's Studio "without ideas". Without
    any programs. This is fundamental because it signifies the total
    abandon of the logocentrism, the lost of that principle which
    establishes that any idea must come always before music. The idea as
    what have to be realised or expressed through music. Or the story
    that has to be narrated "in music". \[...\] We work in the Studio as
    we were gnostics: with immediate intuition, mediate intuition,
    instrumentation and research. It has been the knowledge of the dutch
    philosopher Brouwer to introduce me \[...\] the necessity of the
    "perception of the mutation". We are living in an era of continuous
    mutations, transformations and fragmentations.

[^5]: The space is one of the composing elements, even if from the
    nineteenth century, from the concert hall time and from the opera,
    it does not happen anymore. The italian melodrama has been realised
    with a prefixed construction form. To continue as it was thought
    initially, it could have been like we have only considered truthful
    the only Sonata form a certain specific Beethoven's composition
    period, as he never transformed and twisted the form till the last
    sonatas. This is, for me, thinking the music. And the same thing
    happens with the computer: we have the possibility to program, to
    intervene, to modify and to transform everything completely, in
    real-time. Once a computer is programmed, it will not go forward as
    a locomotive on a railway, which it become unstoppable. The computer
    is not a delegated intelligence. No, the computer is the means that
    obliges you to learn new types of knowledge, \[...\] we verify
    continuously the acoustics and we insert changes in what I have
    written and thought.

[^8]: With the appearance of real-time informatics systems, it has
    become possible to re-put the gesture and the sound in direct
    correspondence, recreating the action-sound-listening-action
    feed-back and, consequently, bringing the computers out of the
    laboratories and conceiving compositions that provided for a live
    performance both autonomous and integrated with other traditional
    and non-traditional instruments.

    only a craft. Music is the thought.
