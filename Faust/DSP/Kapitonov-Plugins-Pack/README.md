### Dependencies for using

1. LV2 or LADSPA compatible host on Linux operating system.
   It can be Ardour, Qtractor, Carla, guitarix.
   VST versions for Windows are planned for the future.
2. Cairo library for GUI.
3. Zita-resampler 1.6+ and zita-convolver 4.0+ libraries (not needed for binary versions).

In Ubuntu run:

`apt install libxcb1 libxcb-util1 libxcb-icccm4 libcairo2 libxau6 libxdmcp6 libpixman-1-0 libfontconfig1 libfreetype6 libpng16-16 libxcb-shm0 libxcb-render0 libxrender1 libx11-6 libxext6 zlib1g libbsd0 libexpat1 libfftw3-3`

### Dependencies for building

1. g++ compiler.
2. Meson-0.51+ build system.
3. Cairo library development files (headers, pkg-info).
4. Boost development files.
5. Zita-resampler 1.6+ development files.
6. Zita-convolver 4.0+ development files.
7. LV2 or LADSPA development files.
8. Faust 2.x compiler and libraries.

In Ubuntu run:

`apt install libxcb1-dev libxcb-util-dev libxcb-icccm4-dev libcairo2-dev libpixman-1-dev libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libxcb-shm0-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxrender-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev zlib1g-dev libbsd-dev libexpat1-dev libfftw3-dev libboost-all-dev lv2-dev ladspa-sdk libzita-resampler-dev libzita-convolver-dev faust meson`

**Attention!!!** Even in Ubuntu Focal Fossa zita-resampler is old 3.x! So use `thirdparty-included`
branch in this case, instead of `master`!

**Attention!!!** Check version of `faust` in your distro! Ubuntu Bionic Beaver has old 0.9.x version!
In this case build latest version of `faust` from source.

**Attention!!!** Check version of `meson` in your distro! Ubuntu Bionic Beaver has old version!
In this case build latest version of `meson` from source.

### How to build and install

Project now uses meson build system (thanks to [cyclopsian](https://github.com/cyclopsian))

1. Run `meson build` and then `ninja -C build` in the source directory.
2. Run `ninja -C build install` to install to /usr/lib/ladspa and /usr/lib/lv2.
   To install to your user directory, run
  `meson build --reconfigure -Dladspadir=.ladspa -Dlv2dir=.lv2 --prefix $HOME` and then
  `ninja -C build install`.
3. Launch host application (e. g. Ardour). Find desired plugin
   in the library. Names will have `kpp_` prefix.
4. If your distribution has old versions of zita-resampler and zita-convolver,
   use 'thirdparty-included' branch instead of 'master'.


### How to install binary versions

1. For Debian Buster (10) download KPP-1.1-binary-debian10.tar.bz2.
2. For Ubuntu LTS and other distributions download KPP-1.1-binary-ubuntu-bionic.tar.bz2.
3. Copy LV2 bundle or LADSPA .so file to the proper place in your system,
   which is in the plugins PATH for your host application. Usually it is
   `/usr/lib/lv2` for LV2 plugins and `/usr/lib/ladspa` for LADSPA plugins.
4. Launch host application (e. g. Ardour). Find desired plugin in library,
   names will have `kpp_` prefix.
