# FX
Audio FX for the Machine Learning Experiments

# We must do this first there are 4 books
* DAFX
* Audio Effects
* Design Audio Effects
* Hack Audios

# You dont have to read them all
* But you will
* If you know nothing start with Hack Audio 
* We make them work in c++ later
* We learn how to do it in Faust
* We can encoder them in Python if you want it
* Hack Audio also has Pythons
