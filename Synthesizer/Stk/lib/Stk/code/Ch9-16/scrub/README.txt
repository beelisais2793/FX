Yo.  This here is scrub, which only works under Windows,
and maybe not even there.  The way to use it is to first
fire up an STK demo process running the Shakers algorithm.
Once that's running, then launch scrub.  Click in the scrub
window once and drag your mouse around.  The mouse motions
and positions are used to send SKINI commands to the sound
synthesis algorithm.

Enjoy!!
