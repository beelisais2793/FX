This directory contains basic routines to start developing
a code for simulating the phi**4 theory with the HMC algorithm
as described during the lectures. 

Here is a short description of the folder content:

main: phi4.c : main program. Compile using make and run as:
      phi4 infile

modules: contains subfolders with the working modules. 
         As a start you will find:

         geometry: hopping.c : initializes the hopping field

         random: ranlxd.c : Luescher's random number generator

         extras: example folder

include: contains the include files:

         lattice.h: contains global variables, the field and
                    its dimensions

         phi4.h: include for the main program

         ranlxd.h: include for ranlxd.c

devel: development folder where you can test your programs

       hmc: check1.c : example of test. Compile using make
