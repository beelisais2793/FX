# anarmonic_oscillator
Solving the differential equation for an anarmonic oscillator in C++

In this project I solved the differential equation for an non-armonic oscillator and compared it to the solution for an armonic oscillator. I used the Runga-Kutta approximation method. 

The main file is prog.cpp, all the others are library needed when running it. A makefile is provided.
The program can produce graphs and outputs using ROOT libraries, but this can be easily changed to produce plots in R or other software. 
The results show an irregular period for the oscillator, as expected by theory.
