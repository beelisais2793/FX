# PercPhysicalModel
Percussion synthesis standalone using physical modelling

This was developed as part of the thesis for the M.Sc. Acoustics & Music Technology, University of Edinburgh in August 2016.
It simulated the vibration of a single plate by mapping incoming MIDI notes to different dimensions and iteratively calculating
the displacement of an output "listening" point (x_0, y_0) at each discrete time step n.

For further details on the mathematical formulation of the physical model please refer to the thesis, **Novel approaches to percussion synthesis: Experiments with physical modelling and non-linear wave-shaping**.
