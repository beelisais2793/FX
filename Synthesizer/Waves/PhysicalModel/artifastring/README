To build from git, run
  ./autogen.sh

To build from a tarball, or to continue a build from git, run
configure as normal, although I recommend a build dir:
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ../configure
To build with debug and swig python bindings, use:
  ../configure --enable-debug --with-swig

To build docs, do
  make docs
