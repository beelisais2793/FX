The pythons scripts add "keyframes" to a blender file based on an
.actions file in order to animate those actions.


NAMES

In order to this, the blender model MUST use certain standard
names for objects and vertex groups.

- an object named "violin".
- 4 objects parented on the violin, named:
  "e-string", "a-string", "d-string", "g-string"
  - each object must contain (at least) 2 vertex groups:
    - "bridge-mark"
    - "nut-mark"
- an object named "bow", parented on the violin.
  - the bow must have (at least) 3 vertex groups:
    - "hair-frog"   (where the hair touches the frog)
    - "hair-point"  (at the "tip" of the bow)
    - "wrapping"    (the silvery part on the stick near the bow)
- cameras:
  - "Camera" - stick wherever you want
  - "Camera.000" - best view for violin
  - "Camera.001" - best view for viola (probably just zoomed violin)
  - "Camera.002" - best view for cello


GENERAL NOTES

- each vertex group can have more than one vertex in it, but only
  one vertex is necessary.

- no objects should have a scale or rotation transform.
  (use object->apply->rotation to "save" a rotation once you are
  happy with the modeling)
