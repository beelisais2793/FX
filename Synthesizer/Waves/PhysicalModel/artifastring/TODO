- include liblo (OSC) and write an OSC server in C++.
- allow use of KISSFFT instead of FFTW (already built-into Eigen,
  so switch to Eigen's FFTs unstead of manually using fftw)
- clean up internal code (remove old code, update variable names)
- switch to 2-finger force bowing
- plugins:
  . pd
  . vamp? (maybe)
