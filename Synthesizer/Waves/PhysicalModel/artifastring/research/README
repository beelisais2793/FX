Material in this directory is not up to the standard of the rest
of Artifastring.  I'm trying to make the rest of this project easy
to use, but I'm not even going to try to clean up stuff in this
research/ directory.

You're welcome to look at this stuff and use it (it's all under
the GPLv3+), but it's in pretty rough shape and you might need to
send me a few emails for hints as to how things work.  Also,
probably about 2/3 of this code is not used at all (they were
earlier drafts that I rewrote, or I decided to pursue a different
method of solving the problem, etc).  So you might spend an hour
trying to decypher how something works, email me, then I might
spend 10 or 20 minutes doing similar decyphering only to remember
that the file(s) aren't used after all.

Good luck!
