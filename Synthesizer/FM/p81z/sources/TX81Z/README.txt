== Based on SOUL example code ==
== Implemenetation by Cesare Ferrari ==

This is a fairly complete implementation of a TX81Z, the limitations are:

1) No LFO
2) Sensitivity - missing PMod, AMS and EBS
3) No detune - you can emulate by adding a fixed component to an oscillator
4) Envelopes - no shift
5) Scaling - no level scaling
